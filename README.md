# cognito

Aim: a Cognito-based setup

* React app with login, logout, register, deregister, forced password update, change password, confirm password,
  enter confirmation code, request re-send confirmation code -- ie, all registration and self-service paraphernalia
  except for MFA
* admin scripts to set up identity pools
